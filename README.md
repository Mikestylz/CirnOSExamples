# CirnOS Examples
In its current state CirnOS lacks many things, one of them being a tutorial.

This repository is intended to function as a tutorial and guidebook for new users of CirnOS, as well as a catalog of everything accomplished using the operating system. Everyone is free to add their own projects to it.
